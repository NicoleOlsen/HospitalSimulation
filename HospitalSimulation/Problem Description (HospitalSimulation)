Problem description

You were asked by a doctor friend to prepare for her a “Hospital simulator”, which can
simulate the future patients’ state, based on their current state and a list of drugs they take.
Patients can have one of these states:
● F: Fever
● H: Healthy
● D: Diabetes
● T: Tuberculosis
● X: Dead

In the “Hospital simulator” drugs are provided to all patients. It is not possible to target a
specific patient. This is the list of available drugs:
● As: Aspirin
● An: Antibiotic
● I: Insulin
● P: Paracetamol

Drugs can change patients’ states. They can cure, cause side effects or even kill a patient if
not properly prescribed.
Drugs effects are described by the following rules:
● Aspirin cures Fever;
● Antibiotic cures Tuberculosis;
● Insulin prevents diabetic subject from dying, does not cure Diabetes;
● If insulin is mixed with antibiotic, healthy people catch Fever;
● Paracetamol cures Fever;
● Paracetamol kills subject if mixed with aspirin;
● One time in a million the Flying Flying Spaghetti Monster shows his noodly power
and resurrects a dead patient (Dead becomes Healthy).
